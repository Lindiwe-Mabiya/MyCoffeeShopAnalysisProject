Welcome to my Coffee Shop Sales Analysis project.<br>
This repository showcases SQL-based data analysis performed on transactional data from a coffee shop that has 3 branches in different locations. The main aim is to inspect and derive actionable insights from sales data to improve decision-making processes and find actionable solutions. The analysis focuses on revenue trends, times in which revenue is high or low, branch performance, and operational efficiency.
